# EdVentureBot

## Run python app.py
...and then watch the magic happen!

## The Inspiration
In today's digital age, Chat-GPT is used by so many people. Those in education sometimes have a negative connotation associated with it because of cheating, however, we wanted to show how powerful it can be for younger students. We build EdVenture Bot to help kids after school when they donâ€™t have direct access to teachers/an adult to ask questions, create a safe space where students can ask clarifying questions without feeling judged, help reduce workload for teachers who may be spread thin and have large classes, and help kids learn concepts in an approachable/funny way with friendly faces and silly characters.

## What was used to Build it
We used OpenAI's API, model "gpt-3.5-turbo", Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JQuery to build our online interactive chatbot.
